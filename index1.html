                <p>There are two aesthetics: the passive aesthetic of mirrors and the active aes­thetic of prisms. When
                    guided by the first, art transforms itself into an ob­jective copy of its surroundings or of the
                    physical history of the individual. When guided by the second, art frees itself, uses the world as
                    its
                    own in­strument, and creates — beyond any spatial and temporal prison — its own personal vision.</p>

                <p>This is the aesthetics of Ultra. It wants to create: that is, to impose so far unsuspected ways of
                    seeing
                    on the universe. It demands from each poet a fresh view of things, clear of any ancestral stigmas; a
                    fragrant vision, as if the world were arising like dawn in front of our eyes. And to conquer this
                    vision, it is essential to cast away every aspect of the past. Everything: right­ angled classical
                    architecture, romantic exaltation, the microscopic observa­tions of the naturalists, the blue
                    twilights
                    that were the lyrical banners of the nineteenth-century poets. That whole absurd vast cell where the
                    ritualists would imprison the marvelous bird of beauty. Everything, until each one of us can make an
                    architectural construction of our own subjective creation.</p>

                <p>From that exposition, the reader will have seen that the ultraist direc­tion is not and never could
                    be
                    weighed down with a difficult set of arbitrary rules — as some would have it. The ultraists have
                    always
                    existed: they are those who, prescient for their times, have brought to the world new aspects of
                    vision
                    and expression. To them we owe evolution itself, the vitality of things. Without them, we would have
                    kept on turning in a circle, around one single light, like moths. El Greco, in relation to his
                    contemporaries, came out an ultraist also, like so many others. Our audacious and conscious creed is
                    not
                    to have a creed. That is to say, we reject all the recipes and corsets so absurdly proper, leaving
                    them
                    for ordinary minds. Our motto is creation for creation. Ultraist poetry has as much cadence and
                    musicality as any other. It has just as much tenderness. As much visuality and more imagination.
                    What is
                    changed is the structure. Each of its most essential innovations has its root in this: the
                    sensitivity
                    and the feeling will always be the same. We make no claim to modify the soul or nature. What we are
                    renovating is the means of expression.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our iconoclastic ideology, what sets the philistines against us, is precisely what enables us. Every
                    great affirmation takes a negation, as our companion Nietzsche said or forgot to say… Our poems have
                    the
                    freewheeling and decisive structure of telegrams.
