                <p>This manyfesto is a provocation, a question, an opening, a dance about a future of AI technologies
                    that is decolonial. We call it manyfesto, since it reflects some truths among many, and we hope
                    to invite exchange, conversation, and the development of more such statements from people affected
                    by
                    AI technology.</p>

                <p>We begin with the challenge posed by the language we use to talk about AI: language that has emerged,
                    as much of the technology has, dominated by Western voices, whiteness, and wealth. We seek to
                    uncover, to question, upend, and reinvent the assumptions underlying this language, even as we use
                    it. </p>

                <p>“Artificial” and “intelligence” are loaded terms, their definitions subject to cultural biases. AI is
                    a technology, a science, a business, a knowledge system, a set of narratives, of relationships, an
                    imaginary. Across each facet, our effort is to undo the colonial erasure of non-Western ways of
                    being and knowing. The word “decoloniality,” too, resonates differently in different communities,
                    including with Indigenous peoples and those for whom colonialism is not a history but a present
                    reality. Some reject the term decolonial in this context. We validate both its use and its
                    rejection.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We do not seek consensus: we value human difference. We reject the idea that any one framework could
                    govern globally. We reject the Western-normative language of “ethical” AI and suggestions of
                    “inclusivity” that do not destabilize current patterns of domination. We reject as half-measures any
                    principles meant to tweak, reinforce, and whitewash the status quo, merely blunting its devastation.
                    They fail to acknowledge how, in present systems, the social and the technical are interwoven, and
                    technologies have immaterial as well as material impacts over specific gendered, racialized bodies
                    and territories. Decoloniality rejects the divorcing of the material and immaterial, of feeling from
                    being, knowing, doing or living.
                </p>
                <p>Notions of decolonial governances will emerge from community and context, questioning what currently
                    constitutes legitimate authority. Decolonialilty is not merely diversity and inclusion; removing the
                    echoes of coloniality in AI will require reparations for past economic, epistemic, and structural
                    injustice and dispossession. These reinventions of AI governance will acknowledge the expertise that
                    comes from lived experience, and create new pathways to make it possible for those who have
                    historically been marginalized to have the opportunity to decide and build their own dignified
                    socio-technical futures. Decolonial governance will recognize, in a way that Western-centric
                    governance structures historically have not, how our roles and destinies are intertwined. </p>
                <p>Our humanity is reflexive, defined by how we relate to one another, including through technology. We
                    owe each other our mutual futures. The primordial vectors of art and narrative are among the paths
                    we will explore. We seek to center the engineering, design, knowledge-production, and
                    dispute-resolution practices of diverse cultures, which are embedded with their own divergent value
                    systems.
                </p>
                <p>Our urgency arises from humans’ capacity to use AI as a knowledge system to create irrefutable
                    “algorithmic truths” to reinforce domination. In doing so, other systems of knowledge production and
                    other truths are denied and erased, as are other peoples’ agency, autonomy, and contestation. In
                    this way AI colonialism extends beyond data colonialism: not merely extractive, the use of AI has
                    the capacity to shape reality. Designed in an unequal society, these systems can be employed to
                    reproduce those inequalities. Built with an emphasis on speed rather than safety, they can do
                    irreparable harm. In insisting on a decolonial AI, we stand for the right of each community to
                    reshape that reality on their terms.
                </p>
                <p>Our methods will evolve, sensitive to needs and opportunities, but our aim is to create and hold a
                    resonant forum for learning and exchange from and between voices silenced by colonialist structures.
